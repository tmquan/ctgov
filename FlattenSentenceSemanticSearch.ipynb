Studies of Ocular Complications of AIDS (SOCA)--Ganciclovir-Cidofovir CMV Retinitis Trial (GCCRT). To compare the newest CMV retinitis drug, cidofovir, with a regimen of the ganciclovir intraocular device plus oral ganciclovir with respect to efficacy in preventing vision loss.\\n\\nTo compare a treatment regimen that incorporates highly active local therapy (ganciclovir device) with a treatment regimen that does not.. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is among the most frequently encountered opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS. In the era of prophylaxis for pneumocystic pneumonia, CMV disease is estimated to affect 45 percent of patients with AIDS sometime between the diagnosis of AIDS and death. Retinitis has been estimated to account for up to 85 percent of CMV disease in these patients, making CMV retinitis the most common ocular infection encountered. CMV retinitis is a relatively late-stage manifestation, associated with cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) + T-cell counts < 100 cells/µL and often < 50 cells/µL.\\n\\nAll currently available treatments for CMV suppress viral replication but do not eliminate the virus from the body. Discontinuation of therapy is associated with a prompt relapse of the retinitis. Despite the use of chronic suppressive therapy, relapse of the retinitis generally occurs, at least with systemically administered anti-CMV drugs.\\n\\nThe first two treatments approved for CMV retinitis were intravenous ganciclovir and intravenous foscarnet. Both are given by daily intravenous infusions and therefore require central venous catheters. The development of newer treatments has focused not only on efficacious treatments, but also on treatments that do not require central venous catheters. Available treatments now include oral ganciclovir, the ganciclovir intraocular device, and intravenous cidofovir.\\n\\nIn vitro data suggest that combination therapies are synergistic in inhibiting viral replication; these therapies include a foscarnet-ganciclovir combination and a cidofovir-ganciclovir combination. In the SOCA--CMV Retinitis Retreatment Trial, the combination of intravenous ganciclovir and foscarnet was more effective than either drug alone for the treatment of relapsed retinitis. Therefore, the combination of intermittent intravenous cidofovir and daily oral ganciclovir may be an attractive therapy for relapsed disease because it may provide synergy for controlling both ocular and visceral disease while not necessitating either a central venous catheter or an intraocular surgical procedure.\\n\\nThe Ganciclovir-Cidofovir CMV Retinitis Trial (GCCRT) is a randomized, multicenter clinical trial. Patients will be assigned to receive one of two regimens: (1) ganciclovir intraocular device plus oral ganciclovir or (2) intravenous cidofovir. The intraocular device will be surgically implanted at baseline and again every 6 to 8 months in eyes with CMV retinitis. Oral ganciclovir is taken at a dose of 1 gram three times daily. Cidofovir will be administered intravenously at 5 mg/kg once weekly for 2 consecutive weeks and once every 2 weeks thereafter. If disease progression occurs in patients receiving cidofovir, patients will be given reinduction therapy, and oral ganciclovir at a dose of 1 gram three times per day will be added to the treatment. If patients assigned to cidofovir are unable to tolerate that regimen, an alternative systemic regimen will be recommended.\\n\\nStudy outcome variables include a decrease of three or more lines from baseline in best corrected visual acuity and rate of visual field loss. The study will also assess other variables including mortality, blood CMV and HIV load, quality of life, and medical costs.\\n\\nTreatment assignment will not be masked to either patients or clinicians; however, reading of fundus photographs to determine both change in retinal involvement and progression will be masked..

The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of a select serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI, sertraline) and a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA, nortriptyline) in outpatients over the age of 60 who have major depression.\\n\\nSSRIs are effective in the treatment of major depression. However, there is also evidence that SSRIs may be significantly less effective than TCAs for patients with late-life major depression with melancholia. Since SSRIs seem to be easier to take than TCAs and are more widely prescribed, it is important to determine which of these types of antidepressants works best to treat these patients.\\n\\nPatients will be assigned randomly to receive either sertraline (a SSRI) or nortriptyline (a TCA) for 12 weeks. Patients will be monitored for symptoms, side effects, and quality of life. If a patient responds to treatment, he/she will participate in a 6-month continuation phase in which he/she will continue to receive the same medication.\\n\\nAn individual may be eligible for this study if he/she:\\n\\nHas unipolar major depression (with some exceptions) and is over 60 years old.. To compare the efficacy and safety of a select serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI, sertraline) and a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA, nortriptyline) in outpatients over the age of 60 who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manuel-IV criteria for unipolar major depression, excluding patients who meet criteria for psychotic or atypical subtype. To test the hypothesis that medication condition interacts with diagnostic subtype (melancholic vs non-melancholic) in determining antidepressant response. To examine the roles of symptom severity and alternative diagnostic subtyping in contributing to this pattern.\\n\\nSSRIs are effective in the treatment of major depression. However, there is also evidence that SSRIs may be significantly less effective than TCAs for depressed patients with melancholia. This issue is of particular concern in late-life major depression. SSRIs have important safety advantages with respect to overdose and a benign cardiovascular profile. Furthermore, the SSRIs do not have significant anticholinergic effects, and appear to be better tolerated than the TCAs. Perhaps most important, the SSRIs currently are prescribed widely as the medication treatment of first choice for major depression in late life. Therefore, if it were determined that SSRIs are considerably less effective than TCAs in the treatment of melancholia in the elderly, there would be significant ramifications for clinical practice.\\n\\nRandomization to sertraline (a SSRI) or nortriptyline (a TCA) is stratified by the presence or absence of melancholia. Outcome measures for the 12-week acute phase include clinician and patient ratings of symptoms, side effects, and an evaluation of the health-related quality of life (HRQOL). At the end of the acute treatment phase, patients who meet criteria for clinical response participate in a 6-month continuation phase..

The purpose of this study is to prevent major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death) in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus using intensive glycemic control, intensive blood pressure control, and multiple lipid management.. BACKGROUND:\\n\\nCurrently, about 17 million Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes and more than 90 percent of them have type 2 diabetes. The number of people with this form of diabetes, formerly known as adult onset or non-insulin dependent diabetes, is growing rapidly. By 2050, the number of Americans with diagnosed diabetes is projected to increase by 165 percent to 29 million, of whom 27 million will have the type 2 form. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in people with type 2 diabetes; these individuals die of CVD at rates two to four times higher than those who do not have diabetes. They also experience more nonfatal heart attacks and strokes.\\n\\nType 2 diabetes is associated with older age and is more common in those who are overweight or obese and have a family history of diabetes. Women with a history of diabetes during pregnancy, adults with impaired glucose tolerance, people with a sedentary lifestyle, and members of a minority race/ethnicity are also at a greater risk for developing type 2 diabetes. African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, American Indians, and some Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are at particularly high risk for type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\\n\\nThe three strategies tested in ACCORD included the following: (1) Blood sugar - ACCORD was designed to determine whether lowering blood glucose to a level closer to normal than called for in current guidelines reduces CVD risk. The study estimated effects on CVD of that level compared with a level that is usually targeted. (2) Blood pressure - many people with type 2 diabetes have high blood pressure. The blood pressure part of the trial was designed to determine the effects of lowering blood pressure in the context of good blood sugar control, that is to determine whether lowering blood pressure to normal (systolic pressure less than 120 mm Hg) will better reduce CVD risk, as compared to a usually-targeted level in current clinical practice (i.e., below the definition of hypertension; systolic pressure less than 140 mm Hg). (3) Blood Fats - Many people with diabetes have high levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol. ACCORD participants who are selected for this part of the trial were assigned to an intervention to improve blood fat levels. This part of the study looked at the effects of lowering LDL cholesterol and blood triglycerides and increasing HDL cholesterol compared to an intervention that only lowers LDL cholesterol, all in the context of good blood sugar control. A drug from a class of drugs called fibrates was used to lower triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol, whereas a drug from the class of drugs called statins was used to lower LDL cholesterol.\\n\\nAll ACCORD participants received blood sugar treatment from the study. Based on the second trial (Blood Pressure or Lipid) they were assigned to, participants also received their high blood pressure or cholesterol care from the study. Study participants received all medication and treatments related to the study free of charge. Individuals who selected for and consented to participate in the ACCORD study continued to see their personal physician for all other health care.\\n\\nIn summary, the ACCORD Study was a double 2x2 factorial design with factors consisting of: intensive versus standard glycemic control, intensive versus standard blood pressure control, and blinded fenofibrate or placebo in combination with simvastatin to maintain desirable LDL-C levels. All 10,251 participants were randomized to the glycemic interventions; a subgroup of 4,733 participants who met the blood pressure entry criteria were randomized to the blood pressure interventions in one 2x2 trial; and a distinct subgroup of 5,518 participants who met the lipid entry criteria were randomized to the lipid interventions in the second 2x2 trial. All participants had established type 2 diabetes and were recruited from 77 clinical centers in the United States (64 sites) and Canada (13 sites).\\n\\nOn February 6, 2008, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) announced that participants in the intensive glycemia treatment would be transitioned to the ACCORD standard glycemic treatment approach due to higher mortality in the intensive treatment group terminating the experimental arm of the Glycemia Trial early. The Blood Pressure and Lipid trials continued as designed to their planned termination in 2009.. Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\nDiagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, as determined by the new American Diabetes Association guidelines, which include a fasting plasma glucose level greater than 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l), or a 2-hour postload value in the oral glucose tolerance test of greater than 200 mg/dl, with confirmation by a retest\\nFor participants aged 40 years or older, history of CVD (heart attack, stroke, history of coronary revascularization, history of peripheral or carotid revascularization, or demonstrated angina)\\nFor participants aged 55 years or older, a history of CVD is not required, but participant must be considered to be at high risk for experiencing a CVD event due to existing CVD, subclinical disease, or 2+ CVD risk factors\\nHbA1c 7.5%-9% (if on more drugs) or 7.5%-11% (if on fewer drugs)',\n",

       "  'Cysteamine Eye Drops to Treat Corneal Crystals in Cystinosis. Trial of Topical Cysteamine in the Treatment of Corneal Cystine Crystal Accumulation in Cystinosis. Cystinosis is an inherited disease that results in poor growth and kidney disease, among other things. The damage to the kidneys and other organs is thought to be due to accumulation of cystine inside the cells of various body tissues. This chemical also accumulates in the cornea-the covering of the eye over the pupil and iris. After 10 to 20 years, the corneas of some patients become so packed with crystals that the surfaces may become irregular, occasionally causing small, painful breaks.\\n\\nPatients enrolled in a NIH study on cystinosis are receiving the drug cysteamine. Taken by mouth, this drug reduces cystine in some tissues, but not in the cornea. This study began in 1986 to test whether cysteamine eye drops could prevent or reduce corneal cystine crystals in these patients. The drops have been very effective in removing crystals and reducing pain in patients who take the medication as directed. Patients who do not take the medication as prescribed do not benefit.\\n\\nAfter the effectiveness of the drops was proven, the main purpose was modified to continue to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of cysteamine eye drops for treating cystine crystals in the corneas of patients with cystinosis until the drops are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). When the New Drug Application (NDA) for the Sigma-Tau standard formulation is granted, this protocol will be terminated.. Protocol 86-EI-0062 began as a randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 0.5% topical cysteamine but was subsequently amended as a natural history protocol. Additional protocols conducted at the National Eye Institute (NEI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) began after this protocol and tested various formulations of cysteamine topical solution for efficacy and safety in patients with cystinosis. Subjects from these NIH protocols testing various formulations were ultimately transferred to this natural history protocol for open-label treatment once it was established that the formulation within this study was the most effective. All subjects enrolled in this protocol received the most effective cysteamine topical solution formulation in both eyes. The control was defined as the natural course of corneal crystal accumulation in patients with cystinosis. The efficacy data were obtained from all of the studies conducted at NIH evaluating various cysteamine ophthalmic solution formulations from 1986 until 2005. The safety data were collected from 1986 until the termination of this protocol in July 2013.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE:\\n\\nThe free thiol cysteamine depletes cystinotic leukocytes and other cells of cystine, whose accumulation is considered the cause of organ damage in cystinosis. This organ damage involves most tissues of the body. Cysteamine therapy improved growth and stabilized renal function in pre-renal transplant cystinosis, without substantial toxicity but there was no noticeable effect on cystine crystal accumulation in the cornea, most likely because of inadequate local cysteamine concentration in the cornea. Previous studies have shown the safety of cysteamine 0.5% topical solution in benzalkonium chloride and its efficacy in resolving the cystine corneal crystals. The main purpose of this protocol is to maintain topical cysteamine treatment in patients with nephropathic cystinosis until the drops are approved by the FDA. When the NDA for the Sigma-Tau standard formulation is granted, the present protocol (86-EI-0062) will be terminated.\\n\\nSTUDY POPULATION:\\n\\nUp to 350 adults and children over two years old, who have a confirmed diagnosis of cystinosis will be enrolled.\\n\\nSTUDY DESIGN:\\n\\nThis is an open label treatment protocol. Eligible subjects will receive drops of cysteamine 0.5% topical solution in benzalkonium chloride hourly while awake in both eyes. They will undergo an eye examination at their baseline visit. They will take cysteamine eye drops in both eyes every hour during waking hours. They will return to the NIH Clinical Center for a follow-up safety eye examination one year after the baseline visit, and then every two years thereafter until the drug is available commercially.\\n\\nOUTCOME MEASURES:\\n\\nThe initial pre-specified primary outcome measure was the reduction of cystine corneal crystals. The post-hoc primary outcome measure (after the protocol was modified) was the collection of safety data.. INCLUSION CRITERIA:\\n\\nPatients must have a documented clinical diagnosis of cystinosis.\\nPatients should be 2 years old or older.\\n\\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\\n\\nInability to travel to NIH for a baseline examination, after 1 year, and every two years thereafter for follow-up\\nInability to cooperate for slit-lamp examination',\n",

      "The Health Influences of Puberty (HIP) Study. Combined Influence of Puberty and Obesity on Insulin Resistance in Adolescents. The Health Influences of Puberty (HIP) Study is designed to explore the relationships between puberty and the onset of type 2 diabetes in adolescents. The results of this study will help us better understand how to prevent type 2 diabetes in these youth. Children go through many changes during puberty, including important hormonal and behavioral alterations. Among these changes, it has long been known that, during puberty, insulin does not work as well as it does before and after puberty. This is called physiologic insulin resistance. In healthy children, this does not cause diabetes or affect blood sugar in any way because the body is able to compensate by making more insulin. Indeed, this is thought to be an important part of the adolescent growth spurt. However, in some children with increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes due to obesity and genetics, the worsening insulin resistance of puberty cannot be compensated for and these youth get diabetes early. The investigators believe this is because type 2 diabetes is rarely, if ever, seen before puberty begins, and the peak of diabetes onset in adolescents occurs at the time of the worst insulin resistance. This specific research project has two goals: 1. To examine effects of obesity on how well the body's insulin works during puberty, and 2. To see if treatment of obese children during this critical period of puberty with a medication that improves insulin resistance (metformin) will help prevent early onset type 2 diabetes.. Specific Aims:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pediatric insulin resistance and related disorders, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are increasing in prevalence, and portend significant end-organ and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus, measures aimed at understanding its causes and preventing its onset are critical. The physiologic decrease in insulin sensitivity in all adolescents during puberty is well-established. It is also known that obese adolescents start out less insulin sensitive at the onset of puberty than lean adolescents, and that their insulin sensitivity worsens as puberty progresses. While there are both longitudinal and cross-sectional data confirming the natural recovery of pre-pubertal insulin sensitivity in normal weight adolescents after puberty is completed, it is unknown whether obese adolescents recover their pre-pubertal insulin sensitivity. Failure to regain pre-pubertal insulin sensitivity at the end of puberty, and failure of compensatory insulin secretion, may accelerate progression from obesity to insulin resistance to T2DM in at-risk youth and contribute to long-term cardiovascular risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, obesity and insulin resistance are associated with earlier onset of puberty and premature adrenarche in females. Insulin resistance also contributes to the gonadal dysfunction of polycystic ovarian disease in fully pubertal females and is associated with hypogonadism in older adult males. Little is known about effects of obesity and insulin resistance on gonadal function in young males. However, persistent metabolic changes at the end of puberty may contribute to gonadal dysfunction in obese youth. Currently, there are few longitudinal studies in either sex that evaluate the interactions among obesity, insulin resistance and gonadal function during puberty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigators' long-term goal is to better understand the metabolic changes that occur during puberty, their underlying mechanisms, and their potential contribution to adult disease. The overall aim is to evaluate the effects of obesity on the evolution of insulin sensitivity and gonadal function during puberty. In addition, because improvement in insulin action during puberty may slow β-cell deterioration, the investigators will evaluate whether compensatory insulin secretion is also affected in obese adolescents and whether treatment with metformin improves β-cell response.\n",

They may use either their own compatible Android handsets, or provided handsets. The study uses a delayed start design. Participants are randomized into two groups, who get access to the module Diastat after 4 and 12 weeks post-enrollment respectively. Each group uses the FTA with Diastat for 8 weeks post-intervention (i.e. access to Diastat).\n",
      "\n",
      "Diastat is a module within FTA that provides data-driven feedback to the patients using their own data. This module is based on the data recorded in a previous trial [1]. Three submodules are part of Diastat; Periodicity detection and visualization, multiscale trend detection based on the c-SiZer algorithm [2], and situation matching for insulin dosage [3].\n",
